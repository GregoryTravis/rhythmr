-- A metagraph is a graph whose
--   nodes are sets of loops
--   edges are pairs of nodes that overlap (non-empty intersection)
-- A k-metagraph is a metagraph where all overlaps are >= k
-- 
-- Given a k-mg we can divide it into connected components.
-- Within each component, each node overlaps at least one other node by at
-- least k.
--
-- We can extract a maximially long chain of nodes from a connected component.
-- This amounts to a sequence of likes where each one overlaps the ones before
-- and after it by at least k.
--
-- Higher k means higher musical coherence between measures.
--
-- A k-song is made by extracting a maximal chain from each connected component
-- of the k-mg and sequencing them in some order.
--
-- For any set of likes, we can determine the length of the k-song that can be
-- built from the k-mg on those likes.
--
-- We can do one or any of these:
-- - Given a desired song length, find the highest k that can produce a song of
--   that length. Alert the user when they have enough likes to make a song of
--   this length.
-- - Show the length of the k-song for each k, and let the user judge offerings
--   until they have a long enough song for their desired k.
